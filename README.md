## Project Brief <a name="projectbrief"></a>
The purpose of this project was 'to create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training'.

Effectively, this meant that I had to create an application based on the training I have recieved which was able to create, read, update and delete data.

### Scope & Additional Requirements <a name="scopeadditional"></a>
In addition to the project brief, there are a set of requirements which the project will also have to meet. These requirements are as followed:
* A Trello board
* A relational database
  * With a minimum of 2 tables
* Clear documentation
  * Describing the architecture
  * Risk assessment
* A functional CRUD application base in Python
  * Following best practices & design principles
* Fully designed test suites
  * Automated tests for validation
  * High test coverage
  * Consistent reports & evidence towards a TDD approach
* A  functioning front-end website using Flask
* Code integrated into a version control system
  * Using the feature-branch model
  * Built through a CI server
  * Deployed to a cloud based virtual machine

### Constraints <a name="constraints"></a>
Due to the limited time and training, there were constraints in the project which mainly impacted to choice of technology and services used in the project. The application had to use technology and services discussed during training.

## Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>
As previously mentioned, there were constraints on which technology and services could be used. As a result of this, below is a list of what was used in the project, with each item being discussed into further detail later on:

* Project Tracking: Trello
* Database: GCP SQL Server
* Programming Language: Python
* Unit Testing: Pytest
* Integration Testing: Selenium
* Front-end: Flask
* Version Control: Git
* CI Server: Jenkins
* Cloud server: GCP Compute Engine

### Project Tracking <a name="projecttracking"></a>
Trello was used to track progress for the project. Trello provided a card based tracking system which allowed easy tracking of what tasks had to be started, which tasks were in progress and which tasks had been completed. Labels were used to manage cards and what each card had represented e.g. Orange labels were used to show items which were part of the minimum viable product. The Trello board can be accessed through the link below:
